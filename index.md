# Join a community crafting an equitable energy transition

## Why We Care

**1 in 5 American households** suffer from energy poverty, defined as spending more than **6% of one's income on energy each month**.

While solar energy could be an affordable and empowering solution for most consumers of the power grid, it remains out of reach due to **high upfront costs** and **complicated financing**.

**Emrgi is using the tried and tested cooperative model** to rethink where the profits from energy markets are directed — to the benefit of our members.

## Emrgi's Cooperative Structure

All those using Emrgi services are **member-owners of the Emergi Cooperative**.

- Fees collected by the cooperative cover ongoing service operations.
- Any remaining funds are passed back to members as **dividends**.

### How It Works

- Members earn points based on **monthly energy usage (in kWh)**.
- The value of points is determined by the **collective wealth** of the cooperative.
- Members choose how many points to **stake** in the pooled fund and how to use them:
  - Reduce energy bills
  - Direct cash withdrawals
  - Invest in additional clean energy

The Emergi Cooperative is **equitable by design**, creating avenues to address systemic injustices in the current power grid.

> We welcome thoughts and feedback as we continue developing this community.

## Providing Relief Through the Emrgi Equity Fund

For **every $1 Emrgi earns**, **$1 is donated** to support families facing unaffordable energy bills.

These donations go to the **Emrgi Equity Fund**, powered by the **Emergi Foundation**, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit.

### The Fund Provides:

- Free upgrades
- Energy assistance
- Relief to households paying more than 6% of income on energy

> The power of the sun is free and abundant. With the right infrastructure, no one should have to limit their energy usage.
